    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>My name is Paul Bute, I'm 27 years old and this is my 2nd semester at OTC. I still refuse to "properly" use the written version of numbers less than 9 because it's ridicilious.

    Before coming to OTC I spent just under 8 years in the workforce, doing various jobs. I spent 4 years and some change working in housekeeping. 2 years working in a warehouse and a year working on cell phone towers. I learned a lot in each position and wouldn't trade the experience I receieved there for anything. Except maybe a million dollars.
