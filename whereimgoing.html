    <h1>After OTC</h1>
    <p>I plan to see how the job market looks and where I feel in my skill level after graduation. If the market looks good, and I feel comfortable in what I know, I may enter the work force immediately. If the job market seems bad, or I feel that I'm lacking skills I could gain at MSU, then I will go on to MSU for a Bachelor's of Science.</p>
    <p>As for my career, I'm currently still deciding which branch of Software Development/Computer Science I want to pursue. Web Development is high on that list, and something I intend to do in my own time if nothing else.</p>
