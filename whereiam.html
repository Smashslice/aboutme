        This is my 3rd semester at OTC, and my 2nd on campus. My first semester was all online, doing Gen Ed classes while deciding what I wanted to do. It had been over 7 years since I had done any form of schooling and I'm glad I started off slow. Last semester I took CIS-120 with Jackson and some other classes that I would rather forget about. This semester, I'm taking my favorite class so far, Web Dev 1 with Merkley. Oh and some other classes too I guess.
