        Everyone needs a break, something to do in their offtime. An intermission between the hard work, the sweat and
        the studying.

    <h3>Gaming</h3>

        Gaming is by far the largest of my hobbies. I play a myriad of games, ranging from competitive tactical shooters
        to strategy games. The two most important parts of a game for me are it's depth and how challenging it is. I
        play games that force me to think and solve problems, because that's what I love doing. To this day, no game has
        pushed me harder than Path of Exile. Despite playing for over a decade, it was only a few years ago that I
        finally beat...almost, every piece of content the game has to offer.

        Surprisingly however, the second game with the biggest impact on my life is Minecraft. I've spent countless hours on Minecraft, though in recent years I tend to play very dense modpacks. I won't get into that here, if I keep going on I might get kicked out of class.
