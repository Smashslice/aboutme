    <h4>How I got here</h4>
    <p class="centeredarticle">
        My "adult" life started at 16, when I got a job working in housekeeping. I worked at the Hilton at the Branson landing for a year before taking a short 3 month break to finish highschool. After graduating I went back and worked at the Hilton Convention Center for another 3 years. Between then and my enrollment at OTC, I worked for 4 different companies. My best memories of those years was 2019 to early 2020, when I did structural modifications on cell phone towers. It was hard work, and I physically couldn't do it anymore, but it's still something I wish I could go back to sometimes.
