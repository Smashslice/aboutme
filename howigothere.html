    <h1>Work In Progress</h1>
    <p>
        Before coming to OTC I spent just under 8 years in the workforce, doing various jobs. I spent 4 years and some change working in housekeeping. 2 years working in a warehouse and a year working on cell phone towers. I learned a lot in each position and wouldn't trade the experience I receieved there for anything. Except maybe a million dollars.
